# Ode
Reactive Ode "framework". 

Created for educational purposes, please do not use in production.

Complete rewrite and a huge ideological change in code. The old version controls the templates automatically which turned out to be a bad decision. Instead, now tha coder is completely in control via vanilla JS and only registers state change listeners that are triggered in proxy set function.

I've written an article about the old version (src_old), you can find it in [here](http://localhost/Blog/?article=reactive-javascript).
